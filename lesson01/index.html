              My name is Kevin Nghiem and I am 26 years old. I was born and
              raised here in San Diego and I am currently working as a Junior
              Engineer at a local engineering/chemistry consulting company. At
              my job, I mainly use python as it is the primary programming
              language used in the company. The project that I am currently
              working on, I am starting to learn and work on a web application
              using react to develop the front end and flask to use python for
              the backend. This ties in with concepts we will be learning in
              this class.
            </p>
            <p>
              The reason I am taking this class is to learn more about web
              development and to learn how to create a website from scratch. From
              this class, I hope to improve on the fundamentals of web
              development and learn how to create a website that is more dynamic
              and interactive.

            </p>
            <p>
              At Miramar college, I am currently studying computer science and
              hope to transfer to SDSU or UCSD when I have completed all of the
              necessary classes. I originally started as a mechanical
              engineering major at SDSU, but when I started working to gain
              experience, I found my interest in developing software and decided
              to make the switch.

              Some of my hobbies are traveling whenever I can get a chance, I
              like cars so I enjoy cruising around, and playing games whenever I
              have some free time. One of my favorite places that I got to visit
              is Japan, I was able to spend three weeks there and got to
              experience a lot of the culture as well as the scenery. Another
              place that I got to visit that I really enjoyed was Hawaii, I was
              able to go snorkeling and see a lot of the marine life there.
