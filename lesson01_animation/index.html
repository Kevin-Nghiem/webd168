          <p>
            My name is Kevin Nghiem and I am 26 years old. I was born and raised
            here in San Diego and I am currently working as a Junior Engineer at
            a local engineering/chemistry consulting company. At my job, I
            mainly use python as it is the primary programming language used in
            the company. The project that I am currently working on, I am
            starting to learn and work on a web application using react to
            develop the front end and flask to use python for the backend. This
            ties in with concepts we will be learning in this class.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason I am taking this class is to learn more about web
            development and to learn how to create a website from scratch. From
            this class, I hope to improve on the fundamentals of web development
            and learn how to create a website that is more dynamic and
            interactive.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Miramar college, I am currently studying computer science and
            hope to transfer to SDSU or UCSD when I have completed all of the
            necessary classes. I originally started as a mechanical engineering
            major at SDSU, but when I started working to gain experience, I
            found my interest in developing software and decided to make the
            switch.

            Some of my hobbies are traveling whenever I can get a chance, I like
            cars so I enjoy cruising around, and playing games whenever I have
            some free time. One of my favorite places that I got to visit is
            Japan, I was able to spend three weeks there and got to experience a
            lot of the culture as well as the scenery. Another place that I got
            to visit that I really enjoyed was Hawaii, I was able to go
            snorkeling and see a lot of the marine life there.
